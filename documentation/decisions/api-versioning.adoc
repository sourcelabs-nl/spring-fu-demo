Rest design

*Decision*

We follow the Zalando guidelines the best we can: 299 is not supported and 410 introduces dead code or an extra framework.
So we will not use this style.

custom headers for deprecated fields
Another style is not to version but to use: field deprecation with headers.

*Decision*

This is a style that can be used; but it's not the standard.
The style is called evolationair api versioning and it's mentioned in the guide.
